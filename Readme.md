#  Titanic Survival Predictor

Welcome to my beginner-friendly Machine Learning project where I built a model to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck 

This was one of my **first ML projects** and a great way to explore the entire ML workflow — from cleaning messy data to deploying a simple web app using Streamlit!



##  Why I Built This

I wanted to:
- Learn the basics of data science and machine learning hands-on
- Understand how models make predictions from real-world data
- Try building something end-to-end and actually *see it work!*

And what better dataset to start with than the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)? 🚢



##  What This Project Does

The model predicts whether a passenger survived based on features like:

- Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Age
- Gender
- Number of siblings/spouses onboard
- Fare paid
- Port of embarkation

It uses **Logistic Regression** for prediction, and I also experimented with Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors.

# What I Learned

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas  
- Handling missing values and encoding categories  
- Training and testing ML models  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Deploying with **Streamlit** for a fun UI experience




If you want to run the app:

### 1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Titanic-Survival-Predictor.git
cd ML-Titanic-Survival-Predictor

### 2. Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Launch the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
